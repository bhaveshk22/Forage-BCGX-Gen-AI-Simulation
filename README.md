# BCG Generative AI Simulation - Forage

This repository contains the work completed during the BCG Generative AI Simulation on Forage. The project involved a series of tasks to demonstrate the application of generative AI in a financial context.

## Project Overview

1. **Data Collection**: 
   - Manually collected financial data from the SEC EDGAR database, focusing on relevant filings for analysis.

2. **Financial Data Analysis**: 
   - Conducted a thorough financial analysis on the manually gathered data, identifying key trends and insights that could inform business decisions.

3. **Generative AI Chatbot Prototype**: 
   - Developed a prototype for a Generative AI chatbot capable of answering financial queries based on the analyzed data. 
   - **Note**: The chatbot currently answers only a specific set of questions, which can be found in the `task_2/questions.txt` file within the `financial_analysis/` folder.
